# TO-DO

List of things I'd like to add

## Coding

- Stricter tests for the algorithms
- Add metadata registering the operations in a consistent manner (50% done, TBC)
- Better interactive browsing of the database (50% done?)
- clear versioning  (Done?)
- Add ``.wave`` and ``.flux`` (or similar) properties for a quicker access to these quantities
- Power law spectra F(lambda) ~ lambda^alpha specified by the spectral index alpha
- Make sure that code works without internet connection
- Make easy to configure different database locations. 
- Make sure that Jansky units work properly
- method to cut spectra

## Spectral Libraries

- Night sky spectrum at different resolutions?
- Moon spectrum at different phases/distances?
- MIR spectra of different objects, preferentially at high resolutions
- UV spectra of galaxies at higher resolution (for LyA studies for example)
- Include a subset of BOSZ spectra (UV-MIR) https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/bosz/


## Filters

- Create a full database of filters so API is more consistent across files

## Docs

- More examples
- More explanations
- Check crosslinks etc

# TO-DO

List of things I'd to add

## Coding

- Stricter tests for the algorithms
- Add metadata registering the operations in a consistent manner
- Better interactive browsing of the database
- clear versioning
- make function ``make_passband`` a class so metadata is better conserved?

## Libraries

- Night sky spectrum at different resolutions
- Moon spectrum at different phases/distances
- MIR spectra of different objects, preferentially at high resolutions

## Filters

- Create a full database of filters so API is more consistent across files

## Docs

- More examples
- More explanations
- Check crosslinks etc

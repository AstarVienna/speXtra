A python tool to manage and manipulate astronomical spectra


## Description

``speXtra`` is a python tool to download, load, display and manipulate spectra of astronomical sources.
It has developed to provide spectral sources to [ScopeSim](https://scopesim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but it may be helpful for other purposes too.

speXtra stands in the shoulder of giants: [synphot](https://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/).

To install ``spextra`` simply run:

```bash
pip install spextra
```

Soon a PyPi version will be available

## Functionalities

``speXtra`` is able to:

- Download spectra from a database and return it in format compatible with ``synphot`` format.

```python
from spextra import Spextrum
sp = Spextrum("kc96/s0")
```


and it will load the S0 galaxy template of the Kinney-Calzetti spectral library. To quickly
plot the resulting spectra, simply type

```python
sp.plot()
```

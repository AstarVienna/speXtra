                               THE AGN ATLAS  


This atlas contains a few spectral templates of AGNs covering the
ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral range (see Table 1 for spectral
coverage). The LINER and Seyfert 2 templates have been obtained with the
large aperture (10" by 20") and low resolution spectrographs of the IUE
satellite. The optical spectra were obtained through a long slit with a 10"
width, were a window of 20" long was extracted to mach the IUE aperture 
(Calzetti 1995, private comm.). The flux of the LINER and Seyfert2 templates
is normalized to a Johnson visual magnitude of 12.5 (STMAG).

The Seyfert1 template consists of an UV spectrum obtained with the IUE low 
resolution spectrographs and of a ground-based optical spectrum. The bright
QSO template is a composite spectrum from the Large Bright Quasar Survey
of Francie and collaborators (1991).  The Seyfert1 and QSO spectral
templates are normalized to a Johnson blue magnitude of 12.5 (STMAG).

The NGC 1068 template is a composite spectrum. The continuum contains the 
nebular, stellar, and power-law contributions. The observed fluxes and FWHM 
of the UV, optical and near-IR emission lines are also incorporated into the
template (J.R. Walsh, private comm; read also the header of the STSDAS binary
for further details).  

Details about how each template has been constructed can be found in the header
of the STSDAS binary file, or in the references given above. The header can be 
read using the tupar task of the IRAF ttools package. STSDAS files can also be
dumped into an ASCII formatted file using the tdump task of the IRAF ttools package.

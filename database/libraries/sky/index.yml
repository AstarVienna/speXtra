library_name : sky

type : background

title : Paranal Night Sky Spectra

summary : |
  This spectra have been generated with skycalc_ipy, an python interface to the ESO Skycalc,
  at different resolutions (vLR: R800, LR: R4000, MR: R20000, HR: R100000)using standard
  parameters. Wavelength steps are logaritmic so so resolution remains constant.    
  Noinstrumental background is included. No scattered Moon light is included. Parameters
  used for running skycalc_ipy are stored in the header of each table. 
  
  Tables also include values for transmission, but those aren't used in spextra and are 
  provided for completeness
  
  Values for emission are in photons s-1 cm-2 angstrom-1 arcsec-2

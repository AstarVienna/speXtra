            THE GALACTIC EMISSION LINE OBJECT ATLAS  


This atlas contains the model spectra of the Orion nebula, and of the 
planetary nebula NGC 7009. The templates cover the wavelength range from
0.1 to 1.1 microns. 

The continuum of the Orion's template contains the nebular contribution
plus a combination of Kurucz model atmospheres to simulated the stellar
contribution. The fluxes of the UV, optical and near-IR emission lines
from different sources are also incorporated into the template (J.R. Walsh,
private comm).  

The continuum of the planetery nebula has a nebular component and a hot
stellar component simulated by an 80000K black body. The fluxes of the UV,
optical and near-IR emission lines, from different sources, are also
incorporated into the template (J.R. Walsh, private comm.).

Details about how each individual template has been constructed can be found
in the header of the STSDAS binary files. The header can be read using the 
tupar task of the IRAF ttools package. Files can also be dump into an ASCII 
formatted file using the tdump task of the IRAF ttools package.

title : High-Resolution Spectra of Habitable Zone Planets

summary : |
  Simulated high-resolution spectra of habitable planets covering a wide parameter space are essential in 
  training retrieval tools, optimizing observing strategies, and interpreting upcoming observations. 
  Ground-based extremely large telescopes like ELT, GMT, and TMT; and future space-based mission concepts 
  like Origins, HabEx, and LUVOIR are designed to have the capability of characterizing a variety of potentially 
  habitable worlds. Some of these telescopes will use high precision radial velocity techniques to obtain the required 
  high-resolution spectra (R≈100,000) needed to characterize potentially habitable exoplanets. 
  Here we present a database of high-resolution (0.01 cm−1) reflection and emission spectra for simulated 
  exoplanets with a wide range of surfaces, receiving similar irradiation as Earth around 12 different host stars 
  from F0 to K7

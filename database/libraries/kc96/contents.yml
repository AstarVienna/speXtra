title : The Kinney-Calzetti Spectral Atlas of Galaxies

summary : |
  The Kinney-Calsetti Atlas consists of an homogeneous set of 12 galaxy spectral
  covering the ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelength range up to about 1 micron.
  The spectra include various morphological types and starburst galaxies.

  This atlas contains a set of galaxy spectral covering the ultraviolet to near-infrared
  spectral range (i.e. from 0.12  to 1 Î¼m). The ultraviolet range of the spectral
  templates was obtained with the large aperture (10" by 20") and low resolution spectrographs
  on the IUE satellite. The optical spectra were obtained through a long slit with a 10" width,
  where a window of 20" long was extracted to match the IUE aperture.

  The spectral templates cover various galaxy morphological types
  from elliptical to late type spiral. Starburst spectra for low
  (E(B-V < 0.10) to high (0.61 < E(B-V) < 0.70) internal extinction are also available.
  Several of the starburst galaxies used are classified as irregulars. Thus,
  although irregular galaxies are not explicitly covered, the starburst templates
  can be used for this morphological type. Details about how the spectra have been
  constructed can be found in Kinney et al. (1996) for the different morphological types,
  and in Calzetti et al. (1994) for the starbursts.

  The flux of the spectra has been normalized to a visual magnitude of 12.5 (STMAG).
  Details about each spectrum can be found in the header of the FITS file.

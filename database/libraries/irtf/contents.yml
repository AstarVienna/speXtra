title : The IRTF Spectral Library

summary : |
  The IRTF Spectral Library is a collection of 0.8-5.0 μm mostly stellar spectra observed at a resolving power of R = λ/Δλ ~ 2000 with the 
  medium-resolution spectrograph, SpeX, at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea. The current release covers mainly 
  solar-metallicity late-type stars with spectral types between F and M and luminosity classes between I and V, but also includes AGB stars, 
  carbon and S stars, and L and T dwarfs. We also include spectra of the giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Later updates will 
  add Wolf-Rayet, O, B, and A stars.

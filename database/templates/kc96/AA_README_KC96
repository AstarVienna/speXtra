            THE KINNEY-CALZETTI SPECTRAL ATLAS OF GALAXIES  


This atlas contains a set of spectral templates of galaxies covering the
ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral range, i.e. from 0.12 up to 1 micron.
The ultraviolet range of the spectral templates has been obtained with the
large aperture (10" by 20") and low resolution spectrographs of the IUE
satellite. The optical spectra were obtained through a long slit with a 10"
width, were a window of 20" long was extracted to mach the IUE aperture.

The spectral templates cover various galaxy morphological types from elliptical
to late type spiral. Starburst templates for low (E(B-V<0.10) to high 
(0.61 <E(B-V)<0.70) internal extinction are also available. Several of the
starburst galaxies used inthe construction of the starburst templates are
classified as irregulars. Thus, although irregular galaxies are no explicitly
covered, the starburst templates can be used to cover this morphological type. 
Details about how the templates have been constructed can be found in Kinney
et al. (1996) for the different morphological types, and in Calzetti et al.
(1994) for the starbursts.

The flux of the spectral templates has been normalized to a visual magnitude
of 12.5 (STMAG system). Details about each individual template can also be
found in the header of the STSDAS binary file. The header of a STSDAS file
can be read using the tupar task of the IRAF ttools package.  STSDAS files can
be dumped into an ASCII formatted file using the tdump task of the IRAF ttools package.

# The curves are extracted from the hyper-z program
		 [Bolzonella et al., 2000, A&A, 363, 476]
  and includes :
	LMC_Fitzpatrick.dat
	MW_Allen.dat
	MW_seaton.dat
	SMC_prevot.dat
	SB_calzetti.dat

  and a modified version of the Calzetti law including contribution 
  from the 2175A bump as proposed by Massaroti et al., 2001, A&A, 380

	SB_calzetti_mod.dat
	
  The extinction curve are expressed in  k(lambda[A]) vs lambda[A]
  therefore applying a E(B-V) means that
      flux_attenuated=flux_intrinsic * 10^[-0.4*k(l)*E(B-V)]

# The atmospheric extinction curves for other purposes 
  There are also atmospheric extinctions from La Silla (ESO) and CTIO
